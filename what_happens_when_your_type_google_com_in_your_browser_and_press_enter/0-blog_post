**What happens when you type `https://www.google.com` and press Enter?**

When you type `https://www.google.com` in your browser and press Enter, a complex series of events occurs to load the requested webpage. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

### 1. DNS Request
When you type a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) like `https://www.google.com`, the first thing that happens is a DNS (Domain Name System) request. Your browser needs to know the IP address of Googleâ€™s servers to communicate with them. The DNS request translates the human-readable domain (`google.com`) into an IP address (for example, `142.250.180.206`).

- **How it works**: Your browser checks its DNS cache for recent lookups of the same domain. If not found, it queries a DNS resolver, which may recursively contact other DNS servers until it finds the authoritative DNS server for `google.com`.

### 2. TCP/IP
Once the browser knows the IP address of the server, it initiates a connection using the **TCP/IP** protocol. This connection is established through the Transport Layer (TCP), ensuring reliable data transfer. Packets of information are broken down and routed between your device and the server using Internet Protocol (IP).

- **Establishing the connection**: The browser sends a TCP "SYN" packet to the server, which replies with an "SYN-ACK" packet, and finally, the browser confirms with an "ACK" packet. This is called the **TCP handshake**.

### 3. Firewall
A firewall acts as a protective barrier between your device and the internet, filtering potentially harmful traffic. During this connection, your firewall (either on your computer or network) ensures that the traffic to Google is safe and meets the set security rules. It prevents unauthorized access and blocks suspicious or malicious data packets.

### 4. HTTPS/SSL
Modern websites, including Google, use **HTTPS**, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. This ensures that your connection is encrypted via **SSL/TLS** to prevent eavesdropping or tampering. The browser and server exchange SSL certificates and establish an encrypted communication channel using asymmetric cryptography.

### 5. Load Balancer
Google uses a vast network of servers, and a **load balancer** helps distribute incoming requests to different servers to optimize performance and reliability. The load balancer ensures that traffic is spread evenly, so no single server gets overwhelmed.

- **Role**: It directs your request to the nearest and most efficient Google server to ensure quick response times.

### 6. Web Server
Once your request reaches one of Google's servers, a **web server** (such as Nginx or Apache) receives the request. The web server handles HTTP requests and serves static resources (such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or images) back to your browser.

### 7. Application Server
In many cases, the web server communicates with an **application server** that runs backend processes or executes dynamic scripts (such as PHP, Node.js, or Python) to serve content tailored to you. For example, if you're logged in, it will retrieve your account details.

### 8. Database
If the requested page involves dynamic content (such as displaying search results), the application server may query a **database** to fetch or update data. This could be a MySQL, PostgreSQL, or NoSQL database depending on the system architecture. The database plays a crucial role in storing and retrieving structured data.

Once all these steps are complete, the Google server responds with an HTML page, which the browser renders for you to see and interact with.

This is the step-by-step process that happens in a fraction of a second when you press Enter after typing a URL in the browser.
